### How to run

(Work in progress)

At this time, the program runs with a custom Google Cloud Oauth2 client with Google Drive and Google Docs API enabled. If you are keen to set up right away:

- Create a [Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) and enable Drive API and Docs API.
- [Create a Oauth2 client for your project](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and [add your email address as a test user](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).
- Clone repository.
- Download the `client_secret_xxx.json` file into the cloned folder, and rename it to `credentials.json`.
- Run `go run main.go`
- Authorize your Google Cloud app with your Google account. Copy redirect URL, extract just the token and paste on the terminal screen.
- `token.json` file should now be created on your folder, which will be used for all API queries. Don't delete this file.

### Plans for the future

- Support downloading in specific formats.
- Support bulk downloading of documents.
- [Submit ideas here!](https://github.com/arunsathiya/download-google-doc/issues)
